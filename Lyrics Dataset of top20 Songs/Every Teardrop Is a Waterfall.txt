I turn the music up, I got my records onI shut the world outside until the lights come onMaybe the streets alight, maybe the trees are goneI feel my heart start beating to my favourite songAnd all the kids they dance, all the kids all nightUntil Monday morning feels another lifeI turn the music upI'm on a roll this timeAnd heaven is in sightI turn the music up, I got my records onFrom underneath the rubble sing a rebel songDon't want to see another generation dropI'd rather be a comma than a full stopMaybe I'm in the black, maybe I'm on my kneesMaybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezesBut my heart is beating and my pulses startCathedrals in my heartAs we saw oh this light I swear you, emerge blinking intoTo tell me it's alrightAs we soar walls, every siren is a symphonyAnd every tear's a waterfallIs a waterfallOhIs a waterfallOh oh ohIs a is a waterfallEvery tearIs a waterfallOh oh ohSo you can hurt, hurt me badBut still I'll raise the flagOhIt was a wa wa wa wa wa-aterfallA wa wa wa wa wa-aterfallEvery tearEvery tearEvery teardrop is a waterfallEvery tearEvery tearEvery teardrop is a waterfall
