Cause you're a skyCause you're a sky full of starsI'm going to give you my heartCause you're a skyCause you're a sky full of starsAnd cause you light up the pathI don't careGo on and tear me apartI don't care if you doCause in a skyCause in a sky full of starsI think I saw youCause you're a skyCause you're a sky full of starsI want to die in your armsCause you get lighterThe more it gets darkI'm going to give you my heartAnd I don't careGo on and tear me apartI don't care if you doCause in a skyCause in a sky full of starsI think I see youI think I see youBecause you're a skyYou're a sky full of starsSuch a heavenly viewYou're such a heavenly view
