Christmas nightAnother fightTears we cried a floodGot all kinds of poison inOf poison in my bloodTook my feetTo Oxford streetTrying to right a wrong"Just walk away", those windows sayBut I can't believe she's goneWhen you're still waiting for the snow to fallIt doesn't really feel like Christmas at allUp above candles on air flickerOh they flicker and they flowAnd I'm up here holding on to all those chandeliers of hopeLike some drunken Elvis singingI go singing out of tuneSinging how I always loved you darlingAnd I always willOh when you're still waiting for the snow to fallIt doesn't really feel like Christmas at allStill waiting for the snow to fallIt doesn't really feel like Christmas at allThose Christmas lightsLight up the streetDown where the sea and city meetMay all your troubles soon be goneOh Christmas lightsKeep shining onThose Christmas lightsLight up the streetMaybe they'll bring her back to meThen all my troubles will be goneOh Christmas lightsKeep shining onOh woah oh oh oh oh ohoOh Christmas lightsLight up the streetLight up the fireworks in meMay all your troubles soon be goneThose Christmas lightsKeep shining on
