Come up to meet ya, tell you I'm sorryYou don't know how lovely you areI had to find you, tell you I need youTell you I set you apartTell me your secrets, and ask me your questionsOh let's go back to the startRunning in circles, coming in tailsHeads on a science apartNobody said it was easyIt's such a shame for us to partNobody said that was easyNo one ever said it would be this hardOh take me back to the startI was just guessing at numbers and figuresPulling the puzzles apart.Questions of science, science and progressDon't speak as loud as my heart.Tell me you love me, and come back and haunt me,Oh, when I rush to the startRunning in circles, chasing tailsComing back as we are.Nobody said it was easyIt's such a shame for us to partNobody said that was easy.No one ever said it would be so hardI'm going back to the start
