I was lost in an endless spaceI couldn't find my wayI looked up and I saw your faceAnd heaven came crashing downYou are my universeIt only revolves around youYou're my Venus and MarsThe moon and the starsIn the velvet skyYou are my universeMy light and my darkness tooFor better or worse you are my curseMy universeCounting the stars in the dessert skySparkle's in your eyesMagic moments in the nightShooting comets all aroundYou are my universeIt only revolves around youYou're my Venus and MarsThe moon and the starsIn the velvet skyYou are my universeMy light and my darkness tooFor better or worseYou are my curseMy universeDance a little closer on the milky wayWrapped around eachother we drift awayWe are falling we are flyingDance a little closer on the milky wayWrapped around eachother we drift awayWe are falling we are flyingForeverYou are my universeMy light and my darkness tooFor better or worseYou are my curseMy universe
